> The important thing is that if you **defer** `tx.Rollback()` you are sure that it will be called even if you do an early return and the "trick" is that calling `tx.Rollback()` on a committed transaction will not actually do the rollback, because once a transaction is committed, it's committed and there is no way to roll it back :) So this is a neat trick on how to keep the code simple.
